- My C experience was pretty flaky... well actually, non-existent.  Roomy is written in C and a prerequisite of the course is to know C or C++.  This is a perfect opportunity for me to learn C so I decided to go through a tutorial online.  http://pw1.netcom.com/~tjensen/ptr/pointers.htm  This tutorial actually worked quite well.  I'm on Chapter 3 and wrote some C in projects/scratchpad while reading though the tutorial.  So far so good!
