/* 
RoomyGraphs consist of Nodes and Edges linking two nodes.
Nodes are stores as uint64 to minimize space.  Considering, 
any given node can have many edges (up to maxEdges, to be
exact) we want to reduce the amount of unnecessary, redundant
space.  So allowing a Node to be of some type occupying more
than sizeof(uint64) bytes, would be a waste because there will
be many copies of it around.  To map your data structures to 
Nodes (which are basically ids) you could have a RoomyHashTable
containing this mapping.

   size that can grow indefintely, but this is not possible.
